window-gallery-0
================

This is the code for my first Window Gallery 516 exhibit.  It is an interactive sound installation, at a storefront window threshold condition, where passerbys will trigger sounds via tactile speakers attached to the window.  Tracking is done with SimpleOpenNI for Processing.  Audio synthesis is done with MaxMSP.  You will need Processing 2.x + SimpleOpenNI (and dependencies) installed in order for the tracking .pde files to work.

Dependencies:
http://www.openni.org/openni-sdk/ (SDK)
http://www.openni.org/files/nite/ (NITE 2.0 - you will need to create an account in order to download form here)
https://code.google.com/p/simple-openni/downloads/detail?name=SimpleOpenNI-1.96.zip (Processing library - this can also be installed from the new Library install interface from the Processing IDE)
